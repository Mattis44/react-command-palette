  name: "React Command Palette."
  text: "a fully customizable command palette for React"
  tagline: "Get started with the most user-friendly command palette in a second."
  actions:
    - theme: brand
      text: Get started
      link: /guide/get-started
    - theme: alt
      text: GitHub
      link: https://github.com/Mattis44/react-command-palette

features:
  - title: Fast & Lightweight
    details: Built for instant response — the palette opens and filters results in milliseconds, even with hundreds of commands. No unnecessary re-renders or heavy dependencies.

  - title: Fully Customizable
    details: Control every part of the experience — from container layout and input styling to item rendering and helper hints. Override inline styles or use CSS variables for full theme flexibility.

  - title: Async & Dynamic Commands
    details: Load commands from APIs or async sources on the fly. React Command Palette supports promises, debounced queries, and async filtering out of the box.

  - title: Global Shortcuts & Modes
    details: Trigger special “modes” with custom shortcuts like “/” or “>”, just like GitHub’s command palette. Perfect for separating search contexts or adding quick actions.

  - title: Native React Integration
    details: 100% React and TypeScript. State-driven, hook-based, and works seamlessly in modern SPAs or Next.js apps. Integrates cleanly with your existing context and routing logic.

  - title: Styled & Accessible by Default
    details: Comes with a minimal, accessible default style — dark/light-ready, keyboard-friendly, and easy to theme. Use the provided CSS variables or your own design system for consistent UX.
